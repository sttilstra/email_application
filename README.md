# email_application

This application allows a user to import a list of email contacts from a CSV file and will automatically create a blank email in outlook for the user selected contact that fills in the To, CC and subject line. Email signatures are retained in emails which are created. It uses tkinter for the front end interface and interacts with outlook via the pywin32 module.
